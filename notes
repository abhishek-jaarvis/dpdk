* Huge pages: It's better to allocate huge pages at the bootup time, so that pages can be allocated before the memory
	fragmentation occurs.
* Size of huge pages : Depends on the cpu flags. On intel, if "pse" is enabled then 2MB, if "pdpe" is enabled then 1GB
* Book-keeping information required for a page allocation is 1KB.
* NUMA : solves the problem of concurrent memory access in an SMP. In an where there is only one system bus, there is contention
	for the bandwidth between multiple processors which might result in starvation of one or more processors in case a single
	processor in using the memory at a given point in time. NUMA based CPUs solve this problem for SMPs but the NON-SMPs solve
	this problem by using the multiple memory-channel architecture.
				 --------------------------------------
	NUMA based performance improvments depends heavily in the nature or running tasks.
* Multiple-channel multiple arch : It increases the channels between memory and the memory-controller
